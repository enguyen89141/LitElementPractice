# LitElement Todo app tutorial 

* This is a Todo app that utilizes LitElement, PWA, and Redux.

## Summary

* Users can add tasks to their todo list and mark them as completed
* There is sorting functionality for active and completed
* Stats will display a pie graph to compare active and completed tasks

### Side Note
* This app uses the Vaadin Graphs pro subscription. 
* As I'm simply expanding my knowledge through tutorials I've only signed up for the 30 day trial which means after 30 days the graph may not appear anymore.
